Ninghai is located on China’s east coast, about 200km south of Shanghai across the Hangzhou Bay. It and many of the other names that appear on the map can be readily identified with place names on modern maps. The map belongs to a Chinese tradition of cartography in which features are pictorially rendered, and distances and relative positions are not shown to scale. Maps belonging to this tradition were widely used in the 17th-19th centuries for representing administrative districts for coastal defense purposes, and it is likely that this map would have had such a function. Compared with the more elaborate examples, which often represent much larger sections of the coast, this is a relatively simple map showing the administrative extent of just a single county town.The map is oriented with East at the top, as if looking out over the East China Sea from the walled town of Ninghai at the bottom. The most distant features represented on the map (such as the island of Tantoushan 檀頭山) are about 60km away from Ninghai. Scales appear to have been considerably compressed in an E-W direction, and the nominal East of the map is in fact more like Southeast. Ruled red lines indicate the limits of responsibility of three administrative units, the Ninghai Jiantiao Left Garrison 寧海徤跳左營, the Linhai Huangbiao Left Garrison 臨海黃標左營 to the south, and the Xiangshan Changshi Garrison 象山昌石營 to the north.

6331,China,Qiu Ying | Style of Li Gonglin,1545,Paper | Pigment,"Scroll painting attributed to Qiu Ying 仇英 (1494 - 1552 CE) in the style of Li Gonglin 李公麟 (1049 - 1106 CE). The subject of the ""Eighteen Luohan"" (Sanskrit: arhat), the Buddha's disciples who attained enlightenment through their own efforts, was a favorite theme in Chinese legend and painting. This painting's silver and gold lines on a dark blue ground, a trait of Chinese and Japanese Buddhist painting from the 8th century CE onward, create a sumptuous yet sublime effect. In China scarcely any paintings of this style remain; this is one of the few known existing pieces. Generally two schools, literati and court artisan, dominated the painting of pre-modern China. The literati painters preferred untrammeled, expressive brush strokes, while the professional court artisans usually paid meticulous attention to detail. Though a professional painter, Qiu was well acquainted with the literati and was active in their circles in Suzhou where he lived. The blending of these two traditions is apparent in this beautiful work. Each Luohan is paired with a poem whose content is a montage of vague terms coupled with fleeting images. These poems suggest influence from the tradition of Chan (Zen) Buddhism.",228.6 cm,unknown

The edict addresses senior provincial officials in the aftermath of the Boxer War of 1900, demanding that they set aside anti-foreign feeling, and work to prevent hostility against foreign merchants and missionaries living in China. The publication of the edict was demanded by Article X of the so-called Boxer Protocol, a punitive diplomatic settlement forced on the Qing dynasty by European nations, the United States, Russia, and Japan after the Boxer War.

6529,India | Mumbai | China (uncertain),unknown,Late 19th Century - Early 20th Century,Silk,"A fully-embroidered sari (akho garo) with a field design of a diagonal grid composed of repeating diamonds. Each diamond contains the same symmetrical arrangement of four floral motifs and rays of linework emitting from them to fill out the diamond shape. The sari being of black mulberry silk in a leno-dent gauze (Chinese: zhī luó 織羅; Gujarati: sali) weave and embroidered primarily in satin stitch (with some stem stitch) using twisted two-ply silk embroidery threads identifies it as a sari for the Parsi market (Gujarati: garo, singluar; gara, plural), likely made either in China or by Chinese embroiderers in Bombay, present-day Mumbai, where there has historically been a significant Parsi population and from where this sari was collected. The Parsi market for Chinese embroideries emerged from the involvement of Parsi merchants in the so-called 'China trade' of Indian opium and cotton for Chinese tea exported to Britain in the 19th century. The border design of peacocks or other long-tailed birds surrounded by a dense array floral motifs was popular in this market. The delicate sprigs of flowers arranged relatively naturalistically draw from Chinese embroidery motifs, distinguishing the designs from the more regularized repeats of the bird-and-flower borders commonly found on embroideries produced in Gujarat for domestic markets during this period (compare with object number 43-12-60).

Small knots sparsely fill the remaining space. The mulberry silk satin in very dark blue (nearly black) and the allover embroidery worked completely in knots (seed stitches; Gujarati: khako) in floss silk identifies the jhabla as likely embroidered in China or by Chinese embroiderers in Surat, Gujarat. The Parsi market for Chinese embroideries emerged from the involvement of Parsi merchants in the so-called 'China trade' of Indian opium and cotton for Chinese tea exported to Britain in the 19th century. The flowing arrangement of the floral border design draws from Chinese embroidery motifs, distinguishing the design from the more regularized repeats of the floral borders commonly found on embroideries produced in Gujarat for domestic markets during this period (compare with object number 43-12-60.

6594,Japan,Shuho,18th Century,Paper | Paint | Brocade,"Painting of Buddha with Sixteen Benign Dignitaries (Shaka ju-roku zenshin) signed by the obscure painter Shuho. This painting represents Buddha surrounded by sixteen benign guardians who include the Chinese monk Xuanzang his attendant, the converted demon Jinja Taisho (深沙大将), and 14 bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas are dressed in celestial attire. Xuanzang is dressed in customary monks' robes with a backpack full of sutras. Among the numerous sutras he carried on back from India during his pilgrimage ( 629-645 CE)  is the Mahaprajna Paramita, the Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom. This important and voluminous sutra, which he translated, quickly gained popularity in China and became a principle text in East Asian Buddhism. Thus, this painting is the pictorial representation of the essence of the sutra - Buddhist wisdom through enlightenment. It also serves as a visual reminder of the merits of Xuanzang, whose deification made him a role model. Many versions of this theme are still extant. They often functioned as the chief object of worship in a temple.",unknown,109.86 cm
6595,Japan | Hiroshima Prefecture,unknown,17th Century,Metallic Thread | Paper | Silk,"Embroidered silk portrait of Uga Benzaiten (Sanskrit: Sarasvati), consort of the Hindu god Brahma, revered in India as the Goddess of music, poetry, and eloquence by both the Brahmins and the Buddhists. As one of the deities in the vast Tantric pantheon, she is usually depicted with a musical instrument in her hands and mounted on a peacock. When Tantric Buddhism penetrated Tibet, China, and Japan, Sarasvati worship entered as well. Influenced by local traditions, Sarasvati, like many Tantric deities, assumed different functions in each region. In Japan, the majority of Benzaiten images are revered as ones which confer happiness, wealth, longevity, and fame. She is frequently depicted holding eight attributes, including a sword, spear, ax, bow, arrow, lasso, thunderbolt and wheel of the law. According to the inscription on the back of the portrait, it was once housed in the Shinto shrine in Itsukushima, Hiroshima prefecture. The red lacquer Torii gate, sacred symbol of this famed shrine which is depicted on her crown, supports this provenience. The small head placed in Benzaiten's crown, a Tantric iconographic trait, seems to represent a Shinto monk. Thus, this rare embroidered portrait illustrates the Shinto-Buddhist syncretism known as Dual Shinto. The embroidery is gold and colored thread on thin silk mounted on a corded tan silk.",172.7 cm,53.8 cm

It is part of a series of four prints with designs dedicated to four important aristocratic lineages in Japan: the Fujiwara, Minamoto, Taira, and Tachibana clans. This print depicts the armor from the Tachibana family with a chrysanthemum and swirling water motif known as kikusui. The design refers to a river in China, lined with chrysanthemums, which provided long life to those who drank from it. Armor featuring this motif was used exclusively by a family descending from the Tachibana lineage. There is also a scroll of  the ""Common Gate"" chapter from the Lotus Sutra being pierced by an arrow. The exact meaning of this is unclear. The print also features a poem by Sokaen Gokumaru which compares the flower on the suit of armor to a plum blossom traditionally displayed in an alcove in a Japanese home.",21 cm,19 cm

The specimens produced from buds and of the best Tibetan rhubarb, procured in 1867, by Mr. P. Darby, then French Consul in Hankou, have been examined in Europe and are described as Rheum officinale. In former times, Guangzhou (Canton) was the only port from which this drug was exported, but now only a small quantity reaches the port, by sea via Shanghai, to be dried at Guangzhou and then to be re-exported. The varieties known in commerce depend on the age of the roots, the soil, and care used in curing it. The Chinese dig the roots early in spring, before the leaves appear, cut them into long flat pieces, dry them for two or three days in the shade and then string them on cords to dry thoroughly in cool places. Good rhubard is yellowish, of a firm texture, when cut has a lively reddish-white mottled appearance, and is perfectly dry. The taste is bitter and unpleasant, and the smell somewhat aromatic. Possesses cooling, laxative, alterative, stomachic, astringent, emmenagogue, eliminative, deobstruent, and diuretic qualities. From Sichuan province. Value at Ningbo, $27 per picul.  Brown slices.

At the beginning of the 7th c. musical progress received a great impetus from the seal of the Crown Prince Umayado.  He is described as the inventor of the O-tsusumi and Ko-tsusumi, the shoulder and side drums of Japan.  It would, however, be more correct to say it is an adaption and modification of the old tsusumi of China.  The faces of the shoulder drum have black laquer rims, one ring inside and ornaments, in the shape of our 3-leaf clover at the six holes through which the cords pass (compare side drum).  The red body of the Chinese drum is replaced by one of black laquer with gold decoration.  In the Japanese drums the center part of the body is molded.

7876,Japan,unknown,18th Century,Paper | Silk | Paint,"Embroidery over painting on paper. This is an example of a large Nirvana painting displayed in many Japanese temples every year on the 19th day of the second lunar month to commemorate the anniversary of the Buddha's death. The custom is an ancient one dating back to 804 CE in Japan and recorded earlier in China. With only minor variations, the content and arrangement, which follow a description in the Mahaparinirvana sutra, is common to all paintings. The combination of embroidery and painting in our example is unusual but not unique. The Buddha lies on a dais in a grove of sal trees whose leaves are dying. In the sky above him a disciple guides the Buddha's mother and her retinue down from heaven to hear the last teachings. Behind the dais a group representing the Great Disciples and Arhats. Lying prostrate with grief in front of the dais is Ananda, Sakyamuni's constant attendant. Near Ananda is seated the child Bodhisattva, Kanyapa. In front and surrounding the center group is a crowd of virtuous laymen, one or two women, Hindu deities including Indra who was present also at the birth of Sakyamuni, guardian kings, such as Virudhaka who wear the skin of an elephant head, and the ruler of the Naga world. At the bottom of the picture is a large group of grieving animals. Elephants, lions, buffalo, peacocks and others are named in the sutra, but any may be included as all beings possess the Buddha nature and are capable of salvation. In the Buddha's previous lives, on his long path to enlightenment, he, himself, had sometimes been born as an animal. Reclining figure of Buddha and the sun in gold thread.  Figures of human and animal mourners in colored thread. Lower section has some unfinished figures.",241.3 cm,117.35 cm
