Said to be one of a collection of oracle bones obtained by Langdon Warner in 1913-14 at the village of Xiaotun at the site of Anyang. Shang Dynasty kings used oracle bones as a form of divination to seek supernatural guidance about important political, social, and personal issues. Usually created from cattle shoulder blades and the underside of turtle shells, the bones were smoothed and then heated until they cracked. By interpreting the cracks, royal diviners believed they were receiving insight that allowed them to answer questions about the future. In many cases, a record of the reading was written on the bones. These texts provide invaluable information about early Chinese religion, politics, and elite life.",,2.2 cm,"Exchange with Peabody Museum, Harvard, 1955"

The goddess is shown having a thousand heads, arms, and legs, and stands on a base decorated with double rows of lotus petals. Schematically represented, the multiplication of her heads is embodied in a cone-like headdress; while her thousand arms form a halo around her body. She wears a long garment with an elaborate jeweled belt, which was originally set with semi-precious stones. Her hands in front are frozen in a ritualized gesture (mudra). She stands astride three mountains, her many feet crushing down upon vast legions of people and animals.This sculpture, like many Tibetan images, embodies an esoteric doctrine in the organization of its formal elements that was perceived and understood only by the initiated believer. Inside the image were both a columnar staff (A1438A) and a prayer scroll (A1438C).

Ninghai is located on China’s east coast, about 200km south of Shanghai across the Hangzhou Bay. It and many of the other names that appear on the map can be readily identified with place names on modern maps. The map belongs to a Chinese tradition of cartography in which features are pictorially rendered, and distances and relative positions are not shown to scale. Maps belonging to this tradition were widely used in the 17th-19th centuries for representing administrative districts for coastal defense purposes, and it is likely that this map would have had such a function. Compared with the more elaborate examples, which often represent much larger sections of the coast, this is a relatively simple map showing the administrative extent of just a single county town.The map is oriented with East at the top, as if looking out over the East China Sea from the walled town of Ninghai at the bottom. The most distant features represented on the map (such as the island of Tantoushan 檀頭山) are about 60km away from Ninghai. Scales appear to have been considerably compressed in an E-W direction, and the nominal East of the map is in fact more like Southeast. Ruled red lines indicate the limits of responsibility of three administrative units, the Ninghai Jiantiao Left Garrison 寧海徤跳左營, the Linhai Huangbiao Left Garrison 臨海黃標左營 to the south, and the Xiangshan Changshi Garrison 象山昌石營 to the north.

These details identify the scene as the story of Ci Fei 佽非 the dragon-slayer, which appears in Chinese literature as early as the 3rd century BCE. According to the story, Ci Fei had acquired a sword of which he was particularly fond. As he crossed the Changjiang River on his way home from the wars, the ferryboat was attacked by a dragon. Fearing more for the loss of his precious sword than for his life, Ci Fei slew the dragon.",,,"Gift of Elise Biddle (Mrs. Harald) Paumgarten, 1948, 1948"

Below him, an ascetic who has been converted is receiving the tonsure at the hands of a monk, while an earlier convert presents him with a robe.  Upper right is Nargarjuna (c. 2nd century CE), a previous great teacher of Buddhism, whose doctrines Bhavaviveka followed:  upper left is a form of the Yidam Samvara (with his consort), B.'s tutelary deity:  lower left is a form of Mahakala, B's demon-protector:  all considered as helping him in the process of extending the faith.

The subject of the ""Eighteen Luohan"" (Sanskrit: arhat), the Buddha's disciples who attained enlightenment through their own efforts, was a favorite theme in Chinese legend and painting. This painting's silver and gold lines on a dark blue ground, a trait of Chinese and Japanese Buddhist painting from the 8th century CE onward, create a sumptuous yet sublime effect. In China scarcely any paintings of this style remain; this is one of the few known existing pieces. Generally two schools, literati and court artisan, dominated the painting of pre-modern China. The literati painters preferred untrammeled, expressive brush strokes, while the professional court artisans usually paid meticulous attention to detail. Though a professional painter, Qiu was well acquainted with the literati and was active in their circles in Suzhou where he lived. The blending of these two traditions is apparent in this beautiful work. Each Luohan is paired with a poem whose content is a montage of vague terms coupled with fleeting images. These poems suggest influence from the tradition of Chan (Zen) Buddhism.",228.6 cm,,"Purchased from Worch of Paris, 1925"

The edict addresses senior provincial officials in the aftermath of the Boxer War of 1900, demanding that they set aside anti-foreign feeling, and work to prevent hostility against foreign merchants and missionaries living in China. The publication of the edict was demanded by Article X of the so-called Boxer Protocol, a punitive diplomatic settlement forced on the Qing dynasty by European nations, the United States, Russia, and Japan after the Boxer War. The text of the edict was specified in Annex No. 16 of the Protocol. The edict is in the voice of the Guangxu emperor but published under the authority of the three senior officials whose names appear at the end. The first of these, Zhang Zhidong, was Viceroy of Huguang at the time of the Boxer War, and one of the group of Viceroys and Provincial Governors to defy the Qing court’s declaration of war on the European and other foreign nations that invaded China during the war.

Each diamond contains the same symmetrical arrangement of four floral motifs and rays of linework emitting from them to fill out the diamond shape. The sari being of black mulberry silk in a leno-dent gauze (Chinese: zhī luó 織羅; Gujarati: sali) weave and embroidered primarily in satin stitch (with some stem stitch) using twisted two-ply silk embroidery threads identifies it as a sari for the Parsi market (Gujarati: garo, singluar; gara, plural), likely made either in China or by Chinese embroiderers in Bombay, present-day Mumbai, where there has historically been a significant Parsi population and from where this sari was collected. The Parsi market for Chinese embroideries emerged from the involvement of Parsi merchants in the so-called 'China trade' of Indian opium and cotton for Chinese tea exported to Britain in the 19th century. The border design of peacocks or other long-tailed birds surrounded by a dense array floral motifs was popular in this market. The delicate sprigs of flowers arranged relatively naturalistically draw from Chinese embroidery motifs, distinguishing the designs from the more regularized repeats of the bird-and-flower borders commonly found on embroideries produced in Gujarat for domestic markets during this period (compare with object number 43-12-60).  Black silk. Semi sheer. Beige flower pattern in blocks formed in rows on the black background. Border embroidered in yellow, beige and red peacocks.",520.7 cm,111.76 cm,"Purchased from F. P.

C681A,Crystal Sphere,https://www.penn.museum/collections/object/335728,https://www.penn.museum/collections/assets/300/528741.jpg,On Display,Asia Galleries - On Display,,Unknown,,19th century CE,Asian,Rock Crystal,,"The Penn Museum's crystal ball was purchased in 1927 from The Far East Shop, a fine arts division specializing in objects made of special gems inside the Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia. It was given as a gift to the Penn Museum in memory of George Byron Gordon, the director of the museum at the time, who had recently passed away. It came with the name ""Dowager Empress"" attached to it, named after the Empress Dowager Cixi who ruled over China's last Dynasty.

This painting represents Buddha surrounded by sixteen benign guardians who include the Chinese monk Xuanzang his attendant, the converted demon Jinja Taisho (深沙大将), and 14 bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas are dressed in celestial attire. Xuanzang is dressed in customary monks' robes with a backpack full of sutras. Among the numerous sutras he carried on back from India during his pilgrimage ( 629-645 CE)  is the Mahaprajna Paramita, the Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom. This important and voluminous sutra, which he translated, quickly gained popularity in China and became a principle text in East Asian Buddhism. Thus, this painting is the pictorial representation of the essence of the sutra - Buddhist wisdom through enlightenment. It also serves as a visual reminder of the merits of Xuanzang, whose deification made him a role model. Many versions of this theme are still extant.

As one of the deities in the vast Tantric pantheon, she is usually depicted with a musical instrument in her hands and mounted on a peacock. When Tantric Buddhism penetrated Tibet, China, and Japan, Sarasvati worship entered as well. Influenced by local traditions, Sarasvati, like many Tantric deities, assumed different functions in each region. In Japan, the majority of Benzaiten images are revered as ones which confer happiness, wealth, longevity, and fame. She is frequently depicted holding eight attributes, including a sword, spear, ax, bow, arrow, lasso, thunderbolt and wheel of the law. According to the inscription on the back of the portrait, it was once housed in the Shinto shrine in Itsukushima, Hiroshima prefecture. The red lacquer Torii gate, sacred symbol of this famed shrine which is depicted on her crown, supports this provenience. The small head placed in Benzaiten's crown, a Tantric iconographic trait, seems to represent a Shinto monk. Thus, this rare embroidered portrait illustrates the Shinto-Buddhist syncretism known as Dual Shinto.

This print depicts the armor from the Tachibana family with a chrysanthemum and swirling water motif known as kikusui. The design refers to a river in China, lined with chrysanthemums, which provided long life to those who drank from it. Armor featuring this motif was used exclusively by a family descending from the Tachibana lineage. There is also a scroll of  the ""Common Gate"" chapter from the Lotus Sutra being pierced by an arrow. The exact meaning of this is unclear.

Rhubarb. The rhubard of commerce, as has been lately discovered, is the root of a species of Rheum, hitherto unknown to botanists. The specimens produced from buds and of the best Tibetan rhubarb, procured in 1867, by Mr. P. Darby, then French Consul in Hankou, have been examined in Europe and are described as Rheum officinale. In former times, Guangzhou (Canton) was the only port from which this drug was exported, but now only a small quantity reaches the port, by sea via Shanghai, to be dried at Guangzhou and then to be re-exported. The varieties known in commerce depend on the age of the roots, the soil, and care used in curing it. The Chinese dig the roots early in spring, before the leaves appear, cut them into long flat pieces, dry them for two or three days in the shade and then string them on cords to dry thoroughly in cool places. Good rhubard is yellowish, of a firm texture, when cut has a lively reddish-white mottled appearance, and is perfectly dry. The taste is bitter and unpleasant, and the smell somewhat aromatic. Possesses cooling, laxative, alterative, stomachic, astringent, emmenagogue, eliminative, deobstruent, and diuretic qualities. From Sichuan province. Value at Ningbo, $27 per picul.  Brown slices.

Along the left hand edge of the image, a vertical line of text provides a date, 1721, and the statement that it was “reverently copied by the devotee Li Jintai of Baishan.” Baishan probably refers to the Changbai mountain range, and by extension to Manchuria.

This is one of the most frequently reproduced images of Confucius, and exists in several versions. An inscription on the stele, reproduced in the rubbing, indicates that the image derives from a painting by the Tang artist Wu Daozi 吳道子, active in the early 8th c. No original by this artist survives, however, so the origin of this image in the works of Wu Daozi cannot be confirmed. The stele from which this rubbing was taken is perhaps one in the Confucius Temple in Qufu 曲阜, Shandong. The image bears four inscribed lines of four characters extolling Confucius’ virtues. These are taken from the “Eulogy of Confucius (孔子讚)” by Chen Fengwu 陳鳳梧 (1475-1541).",,,"Museum Purchase, 1929"

This is one of the most frequently reproduced images of Confucius, and exists in several versions. An inscription on the stele, reproduced in the rubbing, indicates that the image derives from a painting by the Tang artist Wu Daozi 吳道子, active in the early 8th c. No original by this artist survives, however, so the origin of this image in the works of Wu Daozi cannot be confirmed. The stele from which this rubbing was taken is perhaps one in the Confucius Temple in Qufu 曲阜, Shandong. The image bears the inscribed title, “Portrait of the First Teacher, Confucius, Propagating his Teachings”, and four lines of four characters extolling Confucius’ virtues. The latter are taken from the “Eulogy of Confucius (孔子讚)” by Chen Fengwu 陳鳳梧 (1475-1541). The stele from which this rubbing was taken is very similar to, but distinct from, the source of rubbing 29-25-22.",,,"Museum Purchase, 1929"

Quadrangular beaker shape with everted base and flaring rim. An early example, fashioned in the form of hieratic ornament after an ancient bronze ritual vessel, prototypes of which are known to date from the Zhou Dynasty. All four sides and corners are buttressed with vertical dentated ribs or aretes (in Chinese fei-chi) of bronze, showing an unusual cham-leve incrusted enamel enrichment.The cloisonne (Chinese: 珐蓝 falan) decoration on the body is composed with ascending leaf motifs that appear on upper and lower sections in green, relieved by scrolling details in varied tones of blue, red and yellow including red color from crushed Chinese rubies. The small middle section on four sides reveals mask-like lineaments of the ""dreaded land ogre,"" (Chinese: 饕餮紋 taotie wen), an ancient hieratic design, introduced assumably as an admonition against gluttonous evils. The lower flanges of the base uniformly sustain archaic cloisonne bird headed scrolls, and the turquoise blue interior involves lotus flowers amid leafy scrolls executed in varied cloisonne enamel colors peculiar to its provenance. This specimen of Chinese 景泰蓝 ""Jingtailan"" may be characterized as most notable for its inimitable colors, among which may be seen typical lapis lazuli and turquoise blue tones, varied greens, red, and yellow. It dates to the era of Emperor Jingtai (景泰) of the Ming Dynasty (1449 - 1456 CE).",,34.93 cm,"Purchased from Worch of Paris, 1914"

At the beginning of the 7th c. musical progress received a great impetus from the seal of the Crown Prince Umayado.  He is described as the inventor of the O-tsusumi and Ko-tsusumi, the shoulder and side drums of Japan.  It would, however, be more correct to say it is an adaption and modification of the old tsusumi of China.  The faces of the shoulder drum have black laquer rims, one ring inside and ornaments, in the shape of our 3-leaf clover at the six holes through which the cords pass (compare side drum).  The red body of the Chinese drum is replaced by one of black laquer with gold decoration.  In the Japanese drums the center part of the body is molded.  Hand drum for 'Noh' dance and accompaniment to singing.",,,"Gift of Mrs. Sarah (William D.) Frishmuth, 1900"

This is an example of a large Nirvana painting displayed in many Japanese temples every year on the 19th day of the second lunar month to commemorate the anniversary of the Buddha's death. The custom is an ancient one dating back to 804 CE in Japan and recorded earlier in China. With only minor variations, the content and arrangement, which follow a description in the Mahaparinirvana sutra, is common to all paintings. The combination of embroidery and painting in our example is unusual but not unique. The Buddha lies on a dais in a grove of sal trees whose leaves are dying. In the sky above him a disciple guides the Buddha's mother and her retinue down from heaven to hear the last teachings. Behind the dais a group representing the Great Disciples and Arhats. Lying prostrate with grief in front of the dais is Ananda, Sakyamuni's constant attendant. Near Ananda is seated the child Bodhisattva, Kanyapa. In front and surrounding the center group is a crowd of virtuous laymen, one or two women, Hindu deities including Indra who was present also at the birth of Sakyamuni, guardian kings, such as Virudhaka who wear the skin of an elephant head, and the ruler of the Naga world. At the bottom of the picture is a large group of grieving animals. Elephants, lions, buffalo, peacocks and others are named in the sutra, but any may be included as all beings possess the Buddha nature and are capable of salvation. In the Buddha's previous lives, on his long path to enlightenment, he, himself, had sometimes been born as an animal. Reclining figure of Buddha and the sun in gold thread.  Figures of human and animal mourners in colored thread. Lower section has some unfinished figures.",241.3 cm,117.35 cm,"Bequest of Maxwell Sommerville, 1904"
